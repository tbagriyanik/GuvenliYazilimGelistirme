      paragraph: "Input validation is the first line of defense against many common web application vulnerabilities. It involves ensuring that any data received from a user or external system conforms to expected formats, types, and lengths before it's processed. Failing to validate input can lead to code injection, buffer overflows, and other serious security flaws. Always treat external data as untrusted and validate it on the server-side, even if client-side validation is already in place.",

      paragraph: "Authentication confirms a user's identity, typically with credentials like a password and increasingly with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Authorization determines what an authenticated user is permitted to do. A common mistake is to perform an action based only on a user's ID without checking if that user has the specific rights to perform that action. Proper authorization checks must be enforced on every sensitive request to prevent unauthorized access to data and functionality.",

      paragraph: "Cryptography uses mathematical algorithms to transform data into a format that is unreadable without a secret key. It's essential for protecting data confidentiality and integrity. Data in transit should always be encrypted using protocols like TLS (Transport Layer Security) to prevent eavesdropping. Sensitive data at rest, such as customer information in a database, should also be encrypted. It's critical to use well-vetted, standard cryptographic libraries and to avoid inventing custom encryption schemes, which are often flawed.",

      paragraph: "Secure error handling prevents the leakage of sensitive information to attackers. Verbose error messages can reveal system paths, library versions, or database structures, which can aid an attacker. Instead, show generic error messages to users and log detailed, specific information on the server for developers. Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events is crucial for detecting attacks, investigating breaches, and understanding how a system is being used or abused.",

      paragraph: "Data protection involves understanding the data your application handles, classifying it based on sensitivity (e.g., public, internal, confidential), and applying security controls that are appropriate for that classification. This includes data minimizationâ€”collecting and retaining only the data that is absolutely necessary. Secure data disposal is also vital; simply deleting a file often leaves it recoverable, so proper data wiping or destruction techniques should be used when data is no longer needed.",

    modalContent: {
      paragraph: "Many systems are insecure out-of-the-box. Secure configuration involves hardening every layer of the technology stack, including the operating system, web server, application server, and database. This means changing default passwords, disabling unnecessary services and features, and configuring security settings to be as restrictive as possible. Automated configuration management and regular security audits can help maintain a strong security posture and prevent configuration drift over time.",

    modalContent: {
      paragraph: "The Principle of Least Privilege dictates that any user, program, or process should have only the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform its function. For example, a web application should connect to the database with a user account that can only perform required actions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE) on specific tables, rather than using a high-powered administrative account. This principle limits the damage that can result from an accident, error, or exploit.",
