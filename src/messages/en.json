It involves ensuring that any data received from a user conforms to expected formats before processing. A whitelist approach, which only allows known-good characters, is far more secure than a blacklist that tries to block malicious input. For database interactions, always use prepared statements or parameterized queries to ensure user input is treated as data, not executable code."
