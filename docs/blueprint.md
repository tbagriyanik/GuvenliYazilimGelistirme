# **App Name**: SecureBase

## Core Features:

- Interactive Table of Contents: A dynamic table of contents for navigating the security topics. Navigation should have animations and a high-contrast design.
- Section Display: Display each section of the security documentation.
- Code Snippet Generation Tool: Generate code snippets as examples of the principles. Use a tool to identify the ideal cases for LLM snippets to be suggested to the user.
- Real-World Example Database: A collection of real-world security breach examples. These do not have a persistence layer, just static entries.
- Interactive Security Checklists: Provide interactive checklists for application security, with collapsible and expandable fields to keep the presentation clear.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to convey security and trust.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font suitable for both headlines and body text. The overall tone will be objective and neutral.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent different security concepts.
- Use a single-page layout with smooth scrolling to different sections. Implement an animated sticky navigation bar at the top.
- Subtle transitions and animations on hover for interactive elements to enhance user engagement.
